# Testing Eleventy dev server

Reduced test case for 11ty dev server. Both JS and CSS files are generated using NPM scripts.

**Goal**: use 11ty dev server via the `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` CLI command. Use `.eleventy.js` and the `input` option so the dev server watches the ouput folder and reloads the page (with dom diffing or not) every time a file chnages in that folder, be it generated by Eleventy or not.

**Result**: HTML changes are picked up by the server, while JS and CSS file changes are not.
